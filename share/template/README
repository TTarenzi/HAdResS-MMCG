<<<<<<< HEAD
Once installed, this directory contains a Makefile and 
a small program that you could use as a template when 
writing your own analysis software.

A Makefile.arch is created for each architecture you install 
with the correct paths and libraries. You will have to link
(or copy) the correct makefile to "Makefile" or use the -f 
option to gmake in order to select a makefile.

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory, 
there will be a Makefile.am which automake uses to 
create a Makefile.in which in turn is converted to
a Makefile by the configure script. Note that this is
NOT the template makefile - it is called Template.mak,
and used to create Makefile.arch at build time.

You should NOT touch or copy Makefile.in unless you
really know what you are doing - it is a template file
used by the configure script to create the real Makefile.

If you want to use automake and autoconf yourself, look
in the contrib directory of the distribution.
=======
Once installed, this directory contains CMakelist.txt,
Makefile.pkg and a small program that you could use as
a template when writing your own analysis software.

The CMakelist.txt can be used together with cmake to
build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ cmake /path/to/template

The Makefile.pkg can be used if cmake is unavailble. It
makes use of pkg-config only to build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ make -f Makefile.pkg

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory,
remember that CMakelist.txt.template will be renamed to
CMakelist.txt during the installation.
